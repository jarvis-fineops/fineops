# AI in DevOps Pipeline Detection

Machine learning can spot waste in CI/CD workflows faster than manual checks. This guide is part of the [FineOps](../README.md) toolkit and dives into **ai for devops** techniques to tune your pipelines.

## Why This Matters
- Build logs often hide inefficiencies
- Scaling decisions are hard without data
- **DevOps AI** helps surface actionable insights

## How It Works
1. Collect job metrics using **monitoring tools in DevOps**
2. Feed logs and metrics to an anomaly detection model
3. Trigger optimizations automatically with **devops automation tools**

## Real-World Results
- Early tests cut redundant jobs by 20%
- Reduced noise in alerting channels
- Integrates with our [Jenkins CI Cost Cut](../jenkins-ci-cost-cut/README.md) blueprint
