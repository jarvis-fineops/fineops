# AWS Cost Optimization: The Basics That Actually Help

Welcome to the land of endless AWS bills. This isn’t a magic guide, but it *will* help you cut some obvious fat from your setup.

Just follow the stuff below — no buzzwords, no “cloud transformation strategy,” just real things that work.

---

## ☁️ 1. Right-size your instances and databases

Most people start big and never scale down. We get it — easier to overprovision than deal with the app falling over.

But if your t3.large is running at 8% CPU? Yeah, you're wasting money.

- Check EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, etc.
- Use CloudWatch, AWS Compute Optimizer, or just trust your instincts (sometimes faster).
- Go smaller where you can. Dev environments especially — they usually don’t need much.

## 💸 2. Use Reserved Instances or Savings Plans (when stuff is stable)

If you’ve got stuff that runs 24/7 and isn’t going anywhere, don’t pay On-Demand prices like a chump.

- Commit for 1 or 3 years.
- Choose between Standard RIs or Savings Plans (flexibility vs. discount).
- Just… remember to renew them. Or set a Slack reminder or something.

## 🌀 3. Spot instances = big savings (if you're okay with chaos)

Got work that doesn’t mind being interrupted? Spot instances are like EC2, but way cheaper (up to 90% off).

- Great for batch jobs, CI/CD, rendering, testing.
- But beware: they *can* disappear with no warning.
- Don’t use for prod unless you’ve got some fault tolerance in place.

---

## 🏷️ 4. Tag your stuff, or good luck finding the waste

Tag everything. Seriously.

- Who owns it?
- What team/project is it for?
- Is it prod/dev/test/junk?

Then plug into AWS Cost Explorer, filter by tags, and start killing things that shouldn’t exist. There’s *always* a forgotten EC2 instance from 2 hackathons ago still burning $20/month.

## TL;DR

| Principle               | Why it matters                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Right-size             | Don’t pay for capacity you don’t use  |
| Reserved/Savings Plans | Lock in lower prices for steady stuff |
| Spot Instances         | Save big on disposable workloads       |
| Tag + Monitor          | Know what you’re spending on          |

## Not Included (on purpose)

- AI-based auto-scaling magic
- Third-party “cost observability” tools
- Any sentence with the word “leverage”

This is the bare-minimum sanity checklist. Start here before doing anything fancy.
