# Jenkins Autoscaling Cost Savings

This **case study** shows how we used **devops automation tools** to cut build costs on Jenkins. It's part of the [FineOps](../README.md) toolkit for **cloud cost optimization** and highlights techniques useful for teams that want to **hire DevOps engineers** for short-term projects.

## Why This Matters
- High build concurrency was wasting compute hours
- Manual node management slowed delivery
- We needed a scalable solution for a **devops services company**

## How It Works
1. Leveraged **AWS spot instances** to dynamically scale agents
2. Introduced metrics via Prometheus for **monitoring tools in DevOps**
3. Automated provisioning with Terraform modules and GitOps workflows

## Real-World Results
- 45% reduction in monthly CI spend
- Faster job turnaround with autoscaled nodes
- Blueprint available in [Jenkins CI Cost Cut](../jenkins-ci-cost-cut/README.md)

For more patterns see our [Terraform Cost Audit Module](../terraform-cost-audit-module/README.md).
