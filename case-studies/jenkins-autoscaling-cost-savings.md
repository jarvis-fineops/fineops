# Jenkins Autoscaling: Cutting CI Costs Without Slowing Down

This **case study** dives into how we used a mix of automation, spot instances, and GitOps to dramatically cut Jenkins build costs — without sacrificing speed or reliability. It’s part of the [FineOps](../README.md) toolkit for **cloud cost optimization**, and it's especially relevant for teams exploring **DevOps-as-a-service** or looking to bring in **contract DevOps engineers** for quick wins.

## ⚠️ The Problem

Our client — a fast-moving product team — was dealing with:

- **Spiky build traffic**: Some hours had 1–2 jobs, others had 30+. But compute stayed running regardless.
- **Manual node scaling**: Jenkins admins had to log in, scale up agents manually, and pray things didn't break.
- **Wasted compute hours**: On-demand EC2 nodes were chewing through the budget even when idle.

As a **DevOps services company**, we needed to fix this with something scalable, cost-efficient, and maintainable — fast.

## 🔧 What We Built

We implemented a clean, modular autoscaling setup using well-tested DevOps tools:

1. **Autoscaled Jenkins agents with AWS Spot Instances**  
   - Cheap, flexible, and ideal for ephemeral workloads  
   - Built in preemptible fallback logic so builds wouldn’t randomly fail

2. **Integrated Prometheus metrics and dashboards**  
   - Gave visibility into job queue length, node usage, and preemption rates  
   - Allowed quick detection of scaling bottlenecks

3. **Provisioned everything via Terraform + GitOps**  
   - Infra-as-code made environments reproducible  
   - GitOps workflows kept infra changes auditable and reviewable

---

## 📈 The Outcome

- **✅ 45% lower monthly CI costs**  
  Switching to spot agents and killing idle nodes did the heavy lifting here.

- **🚀 Faster job turnaround times**  
  Auto-provisioning meant we scaled *just in time* as builds came in — no more waiting in queue.

- **📦 Reusable blueprint**  
  The full setup (with Terraform modules, spot instance config, and Jenkins integration) is documented in [Jenkins CI Cost Cut](../jenkins-ci-cost-cut/README.md).

## 🛠 Want to Do the Same?

For teams looking to audit or improve their AWS spend, we’ve open-sourced patterns like the [Terraform Cost Audit Module](../terraform-cost-audit-module/README.md). It’s a good starting point for identifying over-provisioned resources.
