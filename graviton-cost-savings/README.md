# Graviton Cost Savings

> ðŸ”Ž This is part of the [FineOps](../README.md) open toolkit for DevOps engineers optimizing cloud infrastructure.

A real-world **graviton2 migration** of EC2 workloads from x86 to ARM using a **multi-arch CI/CD pipeline**.

## How We Saved 30% Using Graviton
- Terraform-managed Auto Scaling groups
- Amazon Linux 2 on Graviton2
- Blue/green deployments via GitOps

## Results
- 20% better performance per dollar
- Up to 30% infrastructure cost reduction

This blueprint shows how we planned the migration with zero downtime and measurable savings.
