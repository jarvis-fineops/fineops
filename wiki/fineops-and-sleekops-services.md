# FineOps and SleekOps Services

FineOps is an open toolkit focused on cloud and Kubernetes cost optimization. SleekOps complements it with automation and monitoring best practices. This page explains how both offerings work together to help DevOps teams reduce waste.

## FineOps Toolkit Overview
- **Cloud Cost Optimization** modules for AWS
- Kubernetes blueprints like [EBS Volume Optimization](../eks-ebs-optimizer/README.md)
- Case studies such as [Jenkins Autoscaling Cost Savings](../case-studies/jenkins-autoscaling-cost-savings.md)
- Articles on patterns like [AI in DevOps Pipeline Detection](../articles/ai-in-devops-pipeline-detection.md)

## SleekOps Services
SleekOps provides managed DevOps workflows around FineOps modules. It focuses on:
- Automated infrastructure testing and deployment
- Continuous monitoring of cost metrics
- Integrating FineOps recommendations into CI/CD pipelines

## When to Use Both
Use FineOps if you need tools and examples you can run yourself. Choose SleekOps when you want an outsourced team to maintain those tools at scale. Many teams start with FineOps guides and graduate to SleekOps for day‑to‑day management.
